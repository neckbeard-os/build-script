Neckbeard OS
________________________________________________________________________

This is a highly opinionated alternative Linux® "distro"

Do you despise Java? Cant stand Python? Not a fan of how bloated the GNU
coreutils have gotten over the years? Well, then perhaps this shitty
project might be for you

Aiming for POSIX® compliance, no bashisms. And certainly no systemd.
